# Comments

[go back to Tutorial](00tutorial.md)

Comments exist to give more information to the written code. Use it to describe your code, so that you and your team can easily understand later what the code does.

This is ho to write a comment in HTML:

```HTML code
<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Use comments to hide content to test the code when an bug occurs:

```HTML code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->

<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
```
