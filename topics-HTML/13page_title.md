# Page Title

[go back to Tutorial](00tutorial.md)

Every web page should have a page title to describe the content and the meaning of the page.

The title is seen in the browser tab.

The `<title>` element adds a title to your page:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Testing HTML and CSS</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

The `<title>` element:

- defines a title in the browser toolbar
- provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
- **most importantly** displays a title for the page in search engine-results

So the most important part is to make the title as accurate and meaningful, for search engine optimization (SEO).
